Office 365 meganb Action Required Recipient Blocked by mail flow rule How to Fix ItAn email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions.Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message.If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so.More Info for Email AdminsStatus code: 550 5.7.1_ETR This error occurs because an email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message.In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.Original Message DetailsCreated Date:10/21/2022 4:29:36 PMSender Address:MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.comRecipient Address:meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject:Incoming call with +17576911826 on Friday, October 21Error DetailsReported error:550 5.7.1 TRANSPORT.RULES.RejectMessage; the message was rejected by organization policy DSN generated by:CY4PR15MB1367.namprd15.prod.outlook.comMessage HopsHOPTIME (UTC)FROMTOWITHRELAY TIME110/21/20224:29:36 PM[127.0.0.1]smtp1.kagoya.netESMTPSA*210/21/20224:29:37 PMsmtp1.kagoya.netDM6NAM04FT039.mail.protection.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server1\u00a0sec310/21/20224:29:38 PMDM6NAM04FT039.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.comDS7PR03CA0146.outlook.office365.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)1\u00a0sec410/21/20224:29:38 PMDS7PR03CA0146.namprd03.prod.outlook.comCY4PR15MB1367.namprd15.prod.outlook.comMicrosoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384)*Original Message HeadersReceived: from DS7PR03CA0146.namprd03.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:5:3b4::31) by CY4PR15MB1367.namprd15.prod.outlook.com (2603:10b6:903:fa::23) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.5723.33; Fri, 21 Oct 2022 16:29:38 +0000Received: from DM6NAM04FT039.eop-NAM04.prod.protection.outlook.com (2603:10b6:5:3b4:cafe::15) by DS7PR03CA0146.outlook.office365.com (2603:10b6:5:3b4::31) with Microsoft SMTP Server (version=TLS1_2, cipher=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) id 15.20.5746.21 via Frontend Transport; Fri, 21 Oct 2022 16:29:38 +0000Authentication-Results: spf=fail (sender IP is 153.127.234.3) smtp.mailfrom=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com; dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=none action=none header.from=m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com;Received-SPF: Fail (protection.outlook.com: domain of m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com does not designate 153.127.234.3 as permitted sender) receiver=protection.outlook.com; client-ip=153.127.234.3; helo=smtp1.kagoya.net;Received: from smtp1.kagoya.net (153.127.234.3) by DM6NAM04FT039.mail.protection.outlook.com (10.13.159.54) with Microsoft SMTP Server id 15.20.5746.16 via Frontend Transport; Fri, 21 Oct 2022 16:29:37 +0000Received: from [127.0.0.1] (unknown [20.89.22.161])by smtp1.kagoya.net (Postfix) with ESMTPSA id 590CA6019D143for <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>; Sat, 22 Oct 2022 01:29:36 +0900 (JST)Content-Type: text/html; name=\"=?UTF-8?Q?=E2=98=8E=EF=B8=8F_voice0989876=5F3-2=2E?= =?UTF-8?Q?htm?=\"Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*0*=utf-8''%E2%98%8E%EF%B8%8F%20voice0989876_3-2.htmX-Ma4-Node: falseFrom: =?UTF-8?B?TTM2NXgyMTQzNTUg4piOwq4=?= <meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>To: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comSubject: Incoming call with +17576911826 on Friday, October 21Message-ID: <d48a87aa-50f9-7ba7-aade-a680e154fd46@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com>Date: Fri, 21 Oct 2022 16:29:36 +0000MIME-Version: 1.0Return-Path: meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.comX-EOPAttributedMessage: 0X-EOPTenantAttributedMessage: dcd219dd-bc68-4b9b-bf0b-4a33a796be35:0X-MS-PublicTrafficType: EmailX-MS-TrafficTypeDiagnostic: DM6NAM04FT039:EE_|CY4PR15MB1367:EE_X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id: 526688d9-52e7-4c29-b83e-08dab3817280", "from_name": "Microsoft Outlook", "from_address": "MicrosoftExchange329e71ec88ae4615bbc36ab6ce41109e@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.com", "to_recipient": [{"emailAddress": {"name": "meganb@m365x214355.onmicrosoft.com", "address": "MeganB@M365x214355.onmicrosoft.com"}}], "flag": "notFlagged"}, {"id": "AAMkAGVmMDEzMTM4LTZmYWUtNDdkNC1hMDZiLTU1OGY5OTZhYmY4OABGAAAAAAAiQ8W967B7TKBjgx9rVEURBwAiIsqMbYjsT5e-T7KzowPTAAAAAAEMAAAiIsqMbYjsT5e-T7KzowPTAATjW2qLAAA=", "sent_time": "2022-10-17T15:42:08Z", "hasAttachments": false, "subject": "Your digest email", "importance": "normal", "conversationId": "AAQkAGVmMDEzMTM4LTZmYWUtNDdkNC1hMDZiLTU1OGY5OTZhYmY4OAAQALvP1PQsL2ZDsXJQWNuXiJ4=", "conversationIndex": "AQHY4j8Du8/U9CwvZkOxclBY25eIng==", "text": "Private to you  Hi, Megan Bowen,Discover trends in your work habitsAn in-depth look at your work patterns in the last four weeks Something to considerSeptember 18 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c October 15 In a typical week, you spend about 12 hours in meetings, most of which are recurring.Planning out when you'll do specific tasks can help you get more done.
